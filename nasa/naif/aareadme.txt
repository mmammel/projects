Brief summary
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This directory contains the SPICE Leapseconds Kernel files for the MSL
     mission. All files are in IEEE text format and must be copied using
     ftp ASCII transfer to any non-UNIX workstation. The following files
     are present in this directory. (Only file names are shown; the file
     name extensions of the text LSK files are always ``.tls''):
 
           naif*      The generic SPICE LSK file(s);
 
           msl        default-name copy of the latest naif*.tls file. The
                      companion file msl.tls.history shows the msl.tls
                      update history.
 
     If multiple versions of generic LSK Kernel file are provided, always
     use the latest version (unless earlier version is needed for some
     special reasons.)
