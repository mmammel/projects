Write a function solve that reorders a singly linked list such that the last element becomes the second element. ie: L0→L1→...→Ln-1→Ln becomes L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→...

Example:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3] 

Note:

this one is busted:

Make sure you return your solution, don't print!

Test Case Failed
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [1,5,2,3,4] # this should be correct based on the problem description

Expected: [1,5,2,4,3]
