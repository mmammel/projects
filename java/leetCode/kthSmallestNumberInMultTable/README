https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-number-in-multiplication-table/


Brutal...my solution is not optimal, it uses some geometry to calculate an area of the table that is as close to k as possible without exceeding it, using a nasty integral of the curve that defines the "nothing is smaller than this square" line.

The good solution is a binary search, just checking for how many values are less than or greater than each guess.
