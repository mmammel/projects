====================
Using Sshtools J2SSH
====================
	
1) First unzip the distribution file into the PATH_OF_YOUR_CHOICE which we refer to as $INSTALL_DIR.
2) Build the JAR files using the ant script $INSTALL_DIR/build.xml
3) Add the JAR files to your class path.
   
=========
JAR files
=========
The Sshtools distribution comes a number jar files, they are

j2ssh-core-VERSION.jar 
The core jar file contains SSH client components, the J2SSH core now implements
most of the basic ssh specifications and implements a number of clients including ssh, sftp and scp.
The core also includes the ssh agent implementation, port forwarding, proxy components and a framework
for extending channels, subsystems and all ssh protocol algorithms.

j2ssh-ant-VERSION.jar
This file contains the J2SSH ant tasks

j2ssh-common-VERSION.jar
The common jar file contains a number of reusable components such as Swing authentication 
prompts, an xml configuration context, remote identification and configuration automation utilites.

j2ssh-daemon-VERSION.jar
The daemon file implements the server side components in conjunction with the j2ssh core.

=====================
J2SSH dependencies
=====================
   
The dependencies vary for J2SSH depending upon the JDK and individual J2SSH jar files required
by your implementation.

If you are using JDK 1.4 or greater, the only dependency the j2ssh jar files require 
is commons-logging.jar with the exception of the J2SSH ant tasks which also require ant.jar

For JDK 1.3.1 the core requires a JCE provider. We have tested the core using the bouncycastle JCE which
is provided with the JDK 1.3.1 distribution file. If you are using the common or daemon jar files with 
JDK 1.3.1 you will also need to include xerces for xml parsing which is also included.

=================
Building Sshtools
=================
    
If you downloaded the source distribution you need to build the binaries before
using sshtools. Like most java appilications today, Sshtools relies on ANT as 
its buildtool. ANT is availale from "http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/".  ANT
requires a build file called build.xml which can be found in the $INSTALL_DIR
directory.
