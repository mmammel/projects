As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm waysto increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on steps necessary to achieve the desiredresultsthrough new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.

This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

In het traditionele China werd van de literatuur geëist dat ze waar was, dat ze een juiste weergaven van de morele situatie en de daardoor opgeroepen gevoelens was.  De literatuur kon haar algemeenvormende functie slechts vervullen wanneer zij de waarheid leerde, en dat kon zij slechts doen wanneer zij een juiste weergave was van de in zijn verscheidenheid in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg.  De meest algemene term voor het begrip literatuur in het Chinees is 'wen'.  Dit woord heeft een brede scala van betekenissen die alle afgeleid zijn van de grondbetekenis van een regelmatig terugkerend patroon, zoals dat bijvoorbeeld ontstaat in een weefsel: 'wen' is de zichtbaren vorm van een immanente structuur.  Het woord voor de in elk aspect van de werkelijkheid als onderdeel van de Weg aanwezige rede, principe, structuur, is 'li'.  Het afzonderlijke schriftteken dat ook 'wen' kan worden genoemd, geeft dus de essentiële trekken van het aangeduide object weer (vanzelfsprekend wordt hierbij uitgegaan van de pictogrammen en ideogrammen), is het object zelf, zodat Chinese lexicografen vaak de betekenis van
In het traditionele China werd van de literatuur geëist dat ze waar was, dat ze een juiste weergave van de morele situatie en de daardoor opgeroepen gevoelens was.  De literatuur kon haar algemeen-vormende functie slechts vervullen wanneer zij de waarheid leerde, en dat kon zij slechts doen wanneer zij een juiste weergave was van de in zijn verscheidenheid in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg.  De meest algemene term voor het begrip literatuur in het Chinees is 'wen'.  Dit woord heeft een brede scala van betekenissen die alle afgeleid zijn van de grondbetekenis van een regelmatig terugkerend patroon, zoals dat bijvoorbeeld ontstaat in een weefsel: 'wen' is de zichtbare vorm van een immanente structuur.  Het woord voor de in elk aspect van de werkelijkheid als onderdeel van de Weg aanwezige rede, principe, structuur, is 'li'.  Het afzonderlijke schriftteken dat ook 'wen' kan worden genoemd, geeft dus de essentiële trekken van het aangeduide object weer (vanzelfsprekend wordt hierbij uitgegaan van de pictogrammen en ideogrammen), is het object zelf, zodat Chinese lexicografen vaak de betekenis van een woord zullen afleiden uit de vorm van het karakter.  Door een gebeurtenis, een situatie en het daardoor opgeroepen gevoel te formuleren, legt de tekst evenzo de in elk aspect van de historische werkelijkheid aanwezige 'li' bloot, de tekst maakt de wereld begrijpelijk.  Als belichaming van de 'li' vertoont de tekst ook zelf een duidelijke ordening.  Literatuur is de geordende verwoording van de in de ogenschijnlijk chaotische werkelijkheid immanente Weg.  Ze is als zodanig onvermijdelijk didactisch.  Desondanks is er sprake van een voortdurende spanning tussen die critici die onder de slogan "teksten dienen als voertuig van de Weg" willen dat de literatuur uitdrukkelijk moralistisch is, en die critici die de uitspraak "poëzie is het verwoorden van gevoelens" naar voren schuiven en vertrouwen op het onvermijdelijke didactische karakter van de formulering van alle oprechte normale gevoelens.  Om een betrouwbare weergave van de in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg te zijn, moeten de in de literatuur beschreven gebeurtenissen waar gebeurd zijn.  Waarheid is het wezen van de literatuur.  Geen betere teksten dat de Klassieken, die de feilloze formulering van de Weg door de heilige vorsten en wijze ambtsdragers uit de oudheid vormen, welke door een voortdurende zelfvervolmaking een volledig inzicht bezaten in de Weg.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of the two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.

The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

AS a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our custome satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired result through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee conveying early in September to draft ideas for imporvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not that changes are effective.  At that time, we migh want to establish the committee as part of our company. They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products

They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well ad our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of the two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers. production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggetstions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for imporvements.  At that time, they could begin with the committee co

One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company. They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers. If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively. An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own. Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries. Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality. After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.

The patient is a male, widowed businessman, born January 12, 1928, who has been diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma and is being regularly treated with flexible sigmoidoscopy on account of perianal discomfort.  The patient was observed for several years to present an incrementally rising level of prostatic antigen and negative interval biopsy specimens.  A course of radiation therapy was completed this year after a positive biopsy report for local prostate cancer.  Subsequently there has been no evidence of metastatic disease or of constitutional or skeletal symptoms, and the patient appears to exhibit excellent mental health.  However, he has complained of chronic lower back discomfort and stiffness sufficient to warrant an MRI which showed no major abnormalities.  He has had recurring back spasms and stiffness but no radicular pain or past radiculopathy.  There has been no change in these symptoms, but his current mental health is good and he has a positive psychological attitude towards his cancer diagnosis.  No nocturia or other major voiding symptoms are reported.  Recent PSA equals 2.6.  A regular examination is recommended before the end of the year.  Other medical history includes remote tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy and excision of basal cell carcinoma from mouth in 1984.  There has been no past history of urinary tract infection.  No current medications are used.  There are no known drug allergies.  Review of endocrine systems reveals no known diabetes or thyroid disease.  Patient had positive PPD in 1965 after military service, but chest x-rays were normal with no INH preventive therapy.  No history of asthma or other respiratory symptoms.  No cardiovascular, GI or GU tract symptoms are present.  No history of anemia or other hematopoietic symptoms.  No headaches or other neurologic symptoms.  Musculoskeletal symptoms include apparent bicipital tendinitis on the right shoulder several months ago but now improved.  In general, the patient appears to be a healthy male.  Vital signs are normal as indicated in the attached report.  Skin shows no rashes or suspicious lesions.  No apparent lymphatic symptoms.  Neck and thyroid not palpable.  Lungs are clear.  Heart rate and rhythm are regular.  Abdomen is flat and not tender.  Extremities appear normal except for slight left bicipital groove tenderness.  In addition, downward movement on abducted arms provokes anterior discomfort.  A neurologic examination was not performed.  External genitalia appear normal.  Rectal exam presents slight diffuse prostate enlargement with no areas of hardness or nodularity.  Stools were negative for occult blood.  Informed consent was obtained and discussed for flexible sigmoidoscopy which revealed no mucosal abnormalities or lesions.  Minimal edema of distal rectum was seen but no erythema, friability or other markers of inflammation.  Impression is of an essentially normal rectosigmoid with no clear radiation proctitis.  The patient's habits and history reveal that he is a nonsmoker, social drinker and takes no illicit drugs.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company. They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers. If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively. An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own. Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries. Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality. After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products. Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment. In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect. By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant. Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving. Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality. Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.

In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

as a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-linne workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee couls also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.

The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company. They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers. If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively. An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own. Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries. Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality. After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products. Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment. In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect. By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant. Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving. Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality. Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions. Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as out customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see

If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively. An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own. Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries. Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality. After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products. Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment. In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect. By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant. Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving. Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality. Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions. Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.
In het traditionele China werd van de literatuur geëist dat ze waar was, dat ze een juiste weergave van de morele situatie en de daardoor opgeroepen gevoelens was.  De literatuur kon haar algemeen-vormende functie slechts vervullen wanneer zij de waarheid leerde, en dat kon zij slechts doen wannneer zijn een juiste weergave was van de in zijn verscheidenheid in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg.  De meest algemene term voor het begrip literatuur in het Chinees is 'wen'.  Dit woord heeft een brede scala van betekenissen die alle afgeleid zijn van de grondbetekenis van een regelmatig terugkerend patroon, zoals dat bijvoorbeeld ontstaat in een weefsel: 'wen' is de zichtbare vorm van een immanente structuur.  Het woord voor de in elk aspect van de werkelijkheid als onderdeel van de Weg aanwezige rede, principe, structuur, is 'li'.  Het afzonderlijke schriftteken dat ook 'wen' kan worden genoemd, geeft dus de essentiële trekken van het aangeduide object weer (vanzelfsprekend wordt hierbij uitgegaan van de pictogrammen en ideogrammen), is het object zelf, zodat Chinese lexicografen vaak de betekenis van een woord zullen afleiden uit de vorm van het karakter.  Door een gebeurtenis, een situatie en het daardoor opgeroepen

Door een gebeurtenis, een situatie en het daardoor opgeroepen gevoel te formuleren, legt de tekst evenzo de in elk aspect van de historische werkelijkheid aanwezige 'li' bloot, de tekst maakt de wereld begrijpelijk.  Als belichaming van de 'li' vertoont de tekst ook zelf een duidelijke ordening.  Literatuur is de geordende verwoording van de in de ogenschijnlijk chaotische werkelijkheid immanente Weg.  Ze is als zodanig onvermijdelijk didactisch.  Desondanks is er sprake van een voortdurende spanning tussen die critici die onder de slogan "teksten dienen als voertuig van de Weg" willen dat de literatuur uitdrukkelijk moralistisch is, en die critici die de uitspraak "poëzie is het verwoorden van gevoelens" naar voren schuiven en vertrouwen op het onvermijdelijke didactische karakter van de formulering van alle oprechte normale gevoelens.  Om een betrouwbare weergave van de in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg te zijn, moeten de in de literatuur beschreven gebeurtenissen waar gebeurd zijn.  Waarheid is het wezen van de literatuur.  Geen betere teksten dat de Klassieken, die de feilloze formulering van de Weg door de heilige vorsten en wijze ambtsdragers uit de oudheid vormen, welke door een voortdurende zelfvervolmaking een volledig inzicht bezaten in de Weg.  De gehele verdere literatuur wordt beschouwd als een voortzetting van de Klassieken, zowel naar vorm als naar inhoud.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council woul brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October

A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as out costomer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of teo possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a compant review committe consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to imporve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the diesired results through new trainin methods and the purchase of additional equipment.

This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one or two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through the new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their reccommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time, we might want to establish

Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we consistantly strive to improve our products, as wellas our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implementone of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company rreview committee consisting of production managers, in- line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas fro improvements. At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time we might want to establish the committee aas

Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implrement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality conrol.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additonal equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.
As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

Hi what is going on today? Well its warm today with clouds and sun. My dog hates the heat. I will take the the doe to the groomer Wednesday. Dinner tonight is chicken on the grill with bake potatoes and green beans. Last night the burgers was good but not that good . I think there was to much grease in the meat that caused the flavor to be missed.Well the testing went ok for the job but my job is a inspector not a computer guy. I hope my resume reflex my ability and not my computer skills.
As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to impliment one of two possible plans to ensure that therse objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the wuality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional euipment.  A possible timeline would begin with teh committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their

At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At thet time, they could deisignate

The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.
The patient is a male, widowed bussinessman, born January 12, 1928, who has been diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma and is being regulary treated with flexible sigmoidoscopy on account of perianal discomfort. The patient was observed for several years to present an incrementally rising level of prostatic antigen and negative interval biopsy speciments.  A course of radiation therapy was completed this year after a positive biopsy report for local prostate cancer.  Subsequently there has been no evidence of metastatic disease or of constitutional of skeletal symptoms, and the patient appears to exhibit excellent mental health.  However, he has complained of chronic lower back discomfort and stiffness sufficient to warrent an MRI which showed no major abnormalities.

The patient is a male, widowed businessman, born January 12, 1928, who has been diagnosed with prostatic carcinoma and is being regularly treated with flexible sigmoidoscopy on account of perianal discomfort.  The patient was observed for several years to present an incrementally rising level of prostatic antigen and negative interval biopsy specimens.  A course of radiation therapy was completed this year after a positive biopsy report for local prostate cancer.  Subsequently there has been no evidence of metastatic disease or of constitutional or skeletal symptoms, and the patient appears to exhibit excellent mental health.  However, he has complained of chronic lower back discomfort and stiffness sufficient to warrant an MRI which showed no major abnormalities.  He has had recurring back spasms and stiffness but no radicular pain or past radiculopathy.  There has been no change in these symptoms, but his current mental health is good and he has a positive psychological attitude towards his cancer diagnosis.  No nocturia or other major voiding symptoms are reported.  Recent PSA equals 2.6.  A regular examination is recommended before the end of the year.  Other medical history includes remote tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy and excision of basal cell carcinoma from mouth in 1984.  There has been no past history of urinary tract infection.  No current medications are used.  There are no known drug allergies.  Review of endocrine systems reveals no known diabetes or thyroid disease.  Patient had positive PPD in 1965 after military service, but chest X-rays were normal with no INH preventive therapy.  No history of asthma or other respiratory symptoms.  No cardiovascular, GI or GU tract symptoms are present.  No history of anemia or other hematopoietic symptoms.  No headaches or other neurologic symptoms.  Musculoskeletal symptoms include apparent bicipital tendinitis on the right shoulder several months ago but now improved.  In general, the patient appears to be a healthy male.  Vital signs are normal as indicated in the attached report.  Skin shows no rashes or suspicious lesions.  No apparent lymphatic symptoms.  Neck and thyroid not palpable.  Lungs are clear.  Heart rate and rhythm are regular.  Abdomen is flat and not tender.  Extremities present peripheral pulses 2  and symmetric with no apparent edema.  Extremities appear normal except for slight left bicipital groove tenderness.  In addition, downward movement on abducted arms provokes anterior discomfort.  A neurologic examination was not performed.  External genitalia appear normal.  Rectal exam presents slight diffuse prostate enlargement with no areas of hardness or nodularity.  Stools were negative for occult blood.  Informed consent was obtained and discussed for flexible sigmoidoscopy which revealed no mucosal abnormalities or lesions.  Minimal edema of distal rectum was seen but no erythema, friability or other markers of inflammation.  Impression is of an essentially normal rectosigmoid with no clear radiation proctitis.  The patient's habits and history reveal that he is a nonsmoker, social drinker and takes no illicit drugs.  He exercises regularly, taking extended walks and swimming daily with no limiting cardiopulmonary symptoms.  The patient's family history reveals that his father died in his late eighties, after having been diagnosed with dementia related to Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer.  His mother died in her early seventies of breast cancer.  A sister also died of breast cancer.  Another sister is alive and well but possibly hypertensive.  A brother is alive with alcoholism.  The patient's wife of thirty years died last year.  One grown child lives at home, three others live nearby.  Overall the patient is a generally healthy man with apparently localized prostate cancer following uncomplicated radiation therapy earlier this year.  Recent PSA was normal.  Recent hemoccult tests were negative and two stool samples submitted today were also negative.  Continued examinations with his primary care physician are scheduled.  The present examination is intended to provide baseline data about the patient that can assist in making future diagnoses and prescribing appropriate treatment.  Included in the record of this examination are indications of the chief complaints of the patient including the nature and duration of the symptoms that caused him to seek medical attention.  Also included is a detailed description of the patient's illness from the appearance of the first symptom to the present time.  The patient's medical history is similarly described in detail along with his personal history, including his age, marital status, dietary habits, sleeping and exercise patterns, daily routine and attitude toward life.  In addition, the patient's family history is reviewed to reveal information about the health of immediate relatives, their ages at death and the causes of their deaths.  Finally, a systematic inventory of bodily systems is provided to reveal subjective symptoms that the patient may have forgotten or considered too unimportant to mention.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is tro form a company review comittee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.
As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own. Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries. Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality. After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products. Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment. In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect. By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant. Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving. Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality. Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions. Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.
As a company, we contantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of prodcution managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At that time, they couldalso designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time, we might want to establish the committe as part of our company. They could meet every month

In het traditionele CHina werd van de literatuur geëist dat ze waas was, dat ze een juiste weergave van de morele situatie en de daardoor opgeroepen gevoelens was.  De literatuur kon haar algemeen-vormende fuctie selchts vervullen wanneer zij de waarheid leerde, en dat kon ze slechts doen wanneer zij een juiste weergave was van de in zijn verscheidenheid in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg.  De meest algemene term voor het begrip literatuur in het Chinees is 'wen'.  Dit woord heenft een brede scale van betekenissen die alle afgeleid zijn van de grondbetekenis van een regelmatig terugkerend patroon, zoals dat bijvoorbeeld ontstaat in een weefsel: 'wen' is de zichtbare vorm van een immanente structuur.

In het traditionele China werd van de literatuur geëist dat ze waar was, dat ze een juiste weergave van de morele situatie en de daardoor opgeroepen gevoelens was.  De literatuur kon haar algemeen-vormende functie slechts vervullen wanneer zij de waarheid leerde, en dat kon zij slechts doen wanneer zij een juiste weergave was van de in zijn verscheidenheid in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg.  De meest algemene term voor het begrip literatuur in het Chinees is 'wen'.  Dit woord heeft een brede scala van betekenissen die alle afgeleid zijn van de grondbetekenis van een regelmatig terugkerend patroon, zoals dat bijvoorbeeld ontstaat in een weefsel: 'wen' is de zichtbare vorm van een immanente structuur.  Het woord voor de in elk aspect van de werkelijkheid als onderdeel van de Weg aanwezige rede, principe, structuur, is 'li'.  Het afzonderlijke schriftteken dat ook 'wen' kan worden genoemd, geeft dus de essentiële trekken van het aangeduide object weer (vanzelfsprekend wordt hierbij uitgegaan van de pictogrammen en ideogrammen), is het object zelf, zodat Chinese lexicografen vaak de betekenis van een woord zullen afleiden uit de vorm van het karakter.  Door een gebeurtenis, een situatie en het daardoor opgeroepen gevoel te formuleren, legt de tekst evenzo de in elk aspect van de historische werkelijkheid aanwezige 'li' bloot, de tekst maakt de wereld begrijpelijk.  Als belichaming van de 'li' vertoont de tekst ook zelf een duidelijke ordening.  Literatuur is de geordende verwoording van de in de ogenschijnlijk chaotische werkelijkheid immanente Weg.  Ze is als zodanig onvermijdelijk didactisch.  Desondanks is er sprake van een voortdurende spanning tussen die critici die onder de slogan "teksten dienen als voertuig van de Weg" willen dat de literatuur uitdrukkelijk moralistisch is, en die critici die de uitspraak "poëzie is het verwoorden van gevoelens" naar voren schuiven en vertrouwen op het onvermijdelijke didactische karakter van de formulering van alle oprechte normale gevoelens.  Om een betrouwbare weergave van de in al het bestaande aanwezige Weg te zijn, moeten de in de literatuur beschreven gebeurtenissen waar gebeurd zijn.  Waarheid is het wezen van de literatuur.  Geen betere teksten dat de Klassieken, die de feilloze formulering van de Weg door de heilige vorsten en wijze ambtsdragers uit de oudheid vormen, welke door een voortdurende zelfvervolmaking een volledig inzicht bezaten in de Weg.  De gehele verdere literatuur wordt beschouwd als een voortzetting van de Klassieken, zowel naar vorm als naar inhoud.

As a company, we constntly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one or two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisitin g of production manager, production- line managers, inspectors and consultants in quality control.  This council could also make wasys to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company. They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers. If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively. An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own. Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries. Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality. After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products. Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment. In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect. By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant. Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving. Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality. Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions. Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as sell as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a conosultant in quality control.  This council would brainstrom ways to increase the quality of production and inpsection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equitment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At the time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet agin October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommeded changes could be implemented in

The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to impove our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisitng of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inpsection methods. The comittee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additinal equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee coneing earyly in September to draft idease for improvements. At that time, they could

This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve out products, as well as out customer satisfaction. In that sprit, we are looking to implement one of two possible palns to ensue that these objsectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.
As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction. In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met. One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control. This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods. The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment. A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements. At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans. The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection. Their recommended changes could be implemented in November. Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective. At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company. They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers. If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively. An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own. Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries. Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality. After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products. Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment. In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect. By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant. Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving. Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality. Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions. Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company we constantly strive to do stuff right but some times it's hard to do that. My name is max, what is your name?  I have a small dog named ditka, he's tiny.  He's also really old.  the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  It's almost 6 in the morning I'm supposed to drive 4 hours to a wedding in 30 minutes but I've been awake all night.  what a nightmare.  Ok here it goes, please work
As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review commitee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods

One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our customer satisfaction.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired resuts through new training methods and thepurchase of additional equipment.  A pssible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they ould also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing theplans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings an decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be schedules to determine whether or not the changes are

At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

As a company, we constantly strive to improve our products, as well as our coustomer satisfacion.  In that spirit, we are looking to implement one of two possible plans to ensure that these objectives are being met.  One pla n is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, productionline workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  Apossible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigatae different methouds for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again October

A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.

One plan is to form a company review committee consisting of production managers, production-line workers, inspectors, and a consultant in quality control.  This council would brainstorm ways to increase the quality of production and inspection methods.  The committee could also make suggestions on the steps necessary to achieve the desired results through new training methods and the purchase of additional equipment.  A possible timeline would begin with the committee convening early in September to draft ideas for improvements.  At that time, they could also designate teams to investigate different methods for accomplishing the plans.  The committee could meet again in October to report back on their findings and decide upon new procedures for our manufacturing and inspection.  Their recommended changes could be implemented in November.  Once the changes are made, a future meeting could be scheduled to determine whether or not the changes are effective.  At that time, we might want to establish the committee as part of our company.  They could meet every month or so to ensure that we are maintaining the highest standards in the quality of our products and the satisfaction of our customers.  If necessary, we could maintain the consultant or hire a full-time quality-control person to see that the recommendations of the committee are implemented promptly and effectively.  An alternative plan calls for a select committee of executives to survey methods of quality control used at companies most similar to our own.  Such companies could include Ajax Manufacturing, the Leviathan Corporation and Olympus Industries.  Under this plan, the executive committee could compile a list of methods used by our rivals to achieve high quality.  After all of the data are compiled, the executive committee would determine which methods would best be adopted to maintain top-notch quality in our products.  Once the new techniques are determined, the executives could purchase any necessary equipment.  In addition, they may also decide upon additional training for managers, workers and inspectors in order to put the new methods into effect.  By presenting employees with a completed plan, rather than asking for suggestions and recommendations, we can save needed time and the cost of hiring an outside consultant.  Under this plan, the executive committee could meet with managers and inspectors weekly to see that the new methods are being properly implemented and that the quality of our products is improving.  Once the initial recommendations are implemented, it might be wise to begin rotating the membership of this committee so all executives could become involved in the drive for higher quality.  Rotating the membership would also allow executives to bring their special expertise to the problem and offer some fresh insights and suggestions.  Please consider the two possible plans and bring your thoughts to our staff meeting next week.
