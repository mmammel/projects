As
a
company,
we
constantly
strive
to
improve
our
products,
as
well
as
our
customer
satisfaction.

In
that
spitit,
we
are
looking
to
implement
one
of
two
possible
plans
to
ensure
that
these
objectives
are
being
met.

One
plan
is
to
form
a
company
review
committee
consisting
of
production
managers,
production-line
workers,
inspectors,
and
a
consultant
in
quality
control.

This
council
would
brainstorm
ways
to
increase
the
quality
of
production
and
inspection
methods.

The
committee
could
also
make
suggestions
on
the
steps
necessary
to
achieve
the
desired
results
through
new
training
methods
and
the
purchase
of
additional
equipment.

A
possible
timeline
would
begin
with
the
committee
convening
early
in
September
to
draft
ideas
for
improvements.

At
that
time,
they
could
also
designate
teams
to
investigate
different
methods
for
accomplishing
the
plans.

The
committee
could
meet
again
in
October
to
report
back
on
their
findings
and
decide
upon
new
procedures
for
our
manufacturing
and
inspection.
